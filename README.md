# MDG-217 camera assembly optional stream format definition kernel patch

Intended to be used together with the [configuration binaries](https://github.com/digitalloggers/geocam-bin) and the [userspace V4L2 plugin](https://github.com/digitalloggers/geocam-v4l2).

## NOTE: this patch is optional; newer versions of the [plugin](https://github.com/digitalloggers/geocam-v4l2) do not require it. It still helps to reduce unknown pixelformat dmesg noise though, but that is better achieved otherwise.
